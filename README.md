# package_template
This is a template to create a Python package for distribution. It is based on the example package found on <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/create-your-custom-python-package-that-you-can-pip-install-from-your-git-repository-f90465867893"> this blog post</a>. The idea of this repository is to save a couple of minutes when creating a new package by having the required files already creaated and some of them might not even need too many changes. As the license states, feel free to use this code in any way without constraints. Most questions are answered in the linked article so I see no point in explaining the structure of this repo.
